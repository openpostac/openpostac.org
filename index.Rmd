### Resources for Post Academics
**Our online book called ["Leaving the Academy: Resources from Open Post Academics"](http://book.openpostac.org/index.html) is openly available.** 

In this book, we share hundreds of resources, links and suggestions that have helped. It outlines the OPA curriculum including notes from our calls and the exercises we did. If you need support as you're thinking about leaving academia it's a helpful place to start. We welcome feedback and additional resources.
