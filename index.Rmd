### Resources for Post Academics
**Our online book called ["Leaving the Academy: Resources from Open Post Academics"](http://book.openpostac.org/index.html) is openly available.** 

In this book, we share hundreds of resources, links and suggestions that have helped others who are thinking about a post academic life. The book mirrors the OPA Fellowship curriculum including notes from our calls and exercises we did. If you need support as you're thinking about leaving academia it's a great place to start. 

We welcome feedback and additional resources.
