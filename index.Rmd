### Upcoming Events and Coffee Chats 

We host workshops and conversations about topics relevant to Post Academics. If you're ABD or have a PhD, you are welcome to join us. 

We also host Coffee Chats on Fridays at 12 noon Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8) as a relaxed way for folks to talk to other post acs and make connections. Events are free of charge and a great way to connect to the OPA community.

These groups are a chance to write in a group setting. Bring anything you want to work on, from an article you want to write to that email youâ€™ve been putting off. Free of charge. 

*Writing groups are coordinated on the #writing channel of the OPA Slack and timing is subject to change. [To sign up for the OPA Slack, please fill out this form.](https://forms.gle/nvLoStXH96evQSJM8)*

### Resources for Post Academics
**Our online book called ["Leaving the Academy: Resources from Open Post Academics"](http://book.openpostac.org/index.html) is openly available.** 

In this book, we share hundreds of resources, links and suggestions that have helped others who are thinking about a post academic life. The book mirrors the OPA Fellowship curriculum including notes from our calls and exercises we did. If you need support as you're thinking about leaving academia it's a great place to start. 

We welcome feedback and additional resources.
