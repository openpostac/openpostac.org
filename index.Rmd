<center> **You can find the materials from the first cohort of Open Post Academics in our online book called ["Leaving the Academy: Resources from Open Post Academics"](http://book.openpostac.org/index.html)**</center> 


<center> *In this book, we share the information from our curriculum including notes from our calls, the exercises we did (plus a few more add ons) as well as hundreds of links and resources to support people with a PhD who are thinking about leaving academia. We welcome feedback and more resources.* </center> 

<br> 
If you'd like to hear more about future cohorts, make sure you're on the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/2932ae7328f2/opa) to receive updates about the program! That's the best way to keep posted about what we're up to.   

### Purpose 
To empower people with a PhD to share their knowledge and skills more openly. 

### Objectives 
- To expand the network of participants to more people outside of academia 
- For participants to understand their skill set and how to apply those abilities to projects outside of academia.
- To create a project that shares those skills openly. 


This website is an introduction to OPA - the Open Post Academic Mentorship Program which was incubated through the [Mozilla Open Leaders program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/open-leaders-x/participants/). We take our [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSDndyEifMT03KAXBs22KHpFRWOa4Gld5vEOoKdcRmyDzQrrsktelKa1jRf9_JeYrC18cjEvce_i3Ri/pub) seriously and request that all who participate in OPA events abide by it.
