Duckles and OPA Contributors Welcome to Open Post Academics This is a set of resources that collected during the Open Post Academics Mentorship Program a program designed to support people with a PhD who are considering leaving academia. It’s drawn from the notes that we used in the workshops and is supplemented with as many resources and links as the participants could find. We’re almost certainly missing resources and links. There are exercises as well which may support you if you’re someone with a PhD who is considering leaving the academy. This is not a perfect document. Please help improve this document by sharing resources and materials that have helped you. Purpose and Objectives Purpose: To empower people with a PhD to share their knowledge and skills more openly. Objectives To expand the network of participants to more people outside of academia For participants to understand their skill set and how to apply those abilities to projects outside of academia. To create a project that shares those skills openly. Contributing Please contribute resources, materials, feedback about books/articles/resources, ideas for assignments, or any other thoughts you have.

["introduction-to-opa.html", "Introduction to OPA Openness as a Mindset Your Open Post Ac Project Activity: Sources of Power Resources Core Resources", " Introduction to OPA What is this program about? What are our goals? Openness as a Mindset Openness is a mindset Three principles for doing open work Mozilla Open Leadership Framework Openness as a mindset means: We can share ideas that matter to us and make them accessible. We can invite people in who might not otherwise be invited to participate. We don’t have to be interested in science, coding or technology to be able to use these principles. We don’t have to be open to everyone everywhere. It matters that we think through things like privacy, ownership and intellectual property. Your Open Post Ac Project Your open project for this program is a way to share your skills in a way that can lead people back to you. This can be incredibly helpful for post acs as it helps us demonstrate what we can do, gives us new networks, and helps share your skills and abilities. This can lead to getting a job/finding new clients. I don’t quite know how it works and I can’t promise you that it will happen to you. But, I do think it helps. I want to encourage you to consider doing an open project that might seem “easy” for you. You might be surprised at how helpful others might find from what you have already done. Some ideas: Share your teaching notes for the class you loved teaching. Put one of your favorite teaching tools or classroom experiences online. Share a paper that never got published in an open repository. Make the notes or your slides from a talk that you gave available. -Take notes from your research/lecture that you love and turn it into an op-ed or a short article. -Put your data in a GitHub repo and make it available for other researchers. It is very important that you DO something for this program If you’re feeling overwhelmed, make the project smaller. More doable. If you’re excited, do one thing first. Then do the second thing. Activity: Sources of Power I’d like to have a discussion about sources of power (descriptions here). Take a look at the discussion of these different forms of power. Which ones are comfortable for you? Uncomfortable? When I considered leaving academia, many of us can feel powerless and without direction. This is a common feeling among post acs and people who are considering leaving. I’d like us to question and investigate the assumption of powerlessness by asking ourselves where we do have power and what is available to us where we are now. Sources of Power Descriptions here Personal Power Co-Power Collaborative Power Positional Power Expert Power Cultural Power Referred Power Obstructive Power Ideological Power Institutional Power Structural Power Transcendent Power Take a moment to look at the descriptions of these kinds of power and consider: What sources of power do you have access to? Where do you not have power? Are there sources of power that are not on this list that matter to you?

["working-openly.html", "Working Openly What is Openness? An Example of Using Openness Open Licensing Resources", " Working Openly Why work openly? What tools exist for open scholarship? How do open licenses work? How can we use social media tools for our benefit? What is Openness? Three principles for doing open work Mozilla Open Leadership Framework Understanding: You make the work accessible and clear. Sharing: You make the work easy to adapt, reproduce, and spread. Participation &amp; Inclusion: You build shared ownership and agency with contributors through accountability, equity, and transparency to make the work inviting, relevant, safe, and sustainable for all. Open work generally aspires to meet these criteria, but it is not all required. Sometimes we cannot make work understandable to all or we might have a very specific audience. We might not share something fully with everyone, or people might not be able to give their feedback or participate because of legitimate reasons. These are aspirations and orientations towards what we create. We don’t have to do it perfectly, but to work towards this, or to be oriented towards more openness as much as possible. Openness is a mindset. For instance work we might do would NOT meet these criteria and therefore be less open: A scholar publishes in their field using a lot of technical jargon about a community they have worked with. This text is not available publicly for people to read except by paying a publisher a lot of money. The researcher is not responsive to people in the community they studied who have problems with his research. By contrast, a researcher could publish an easier to read (though still scholarly) article about a community they’ve worked with and make it available to others via an institutional repository or an Open Access Journal. They could also respond to and even include the community they studied in the writing process. How to Work Openly Make a topic that is otherwise difficult to understand more comprehensible for people who are not experts in your field. Publish/share/disseminate what you create on the internet Share it with people who might want/need it and encourage them to use it and give you feedback. Share it on popular websites, social media or other ways that people can stumble upon it. Use a creative commons or other appropriate open license so that others can take your work and build on it more. Ask for people to comment on it and respond to their comments. KEY POINT: You do not have to do all of these things to have an open project, choose judiciously what makes the most sense for your project. Openness is an orientation, not a checkbox. The easiest route for this is to do something that will help you make your expertise more understandable, possible to find and to respond to. Consider what you already have written/created that might be made more open (writing, teaching materials, syllabi). You might also accumulate resources/links/materials and comment on them, being an information broker. This is a valuable resource. Think about what is easy for you. If you can give a three minute lecture on a topic of interest to many people, why not do a quick video and share that on youtube? No need to make this harder than it needs to be. An Example of Using Openness You do a talk that is well received and someone asks for your slides. How do you get it to them? The easiest response is to send them an email with the slides as an attachment. But what happens if you change the slides in the future? What happens if they want to share this with other people? Should they? Do they have to ask for permission to do so? Do you want to be responding to emails from people asking to use your slides? Another idea is you could share this slide via google docs or a cloud based system like Dropbox. This allows them to have the slides and you to have the same slides. Changes/typos etc. can be updated. Permissions can be granted. You can control who sees it. Let’s go a bit further, if one person wants these slides, surely someone might want to see them too - how might you share your slides more broadly? Personal websites GitHub/GitLabs (think of these as libraries that contain - multiple versions of code or data as it’s being built) Video of talk Twitter Slideshare Openness is a continuum between full privacy and openness. You are on that continuum when you think about how to share slides from a talk you gave. Do you send an email with an attachment? Do you give them a google docs/dropbox link? Do you put the video on your personal website? How do you inform them of what they can do with your work? The idea of openness is to champion a choice to put things into the open so that more people can see, respond and be included in the creation and use of information and materials online. You always get to choose how you want to be open and of course there are tradeoffs with openness. ### Three Open Practices {-} - Design: Make contextual, deliberate decisions about how and when to be open - Build: Create structures and systems that ensure clarity and process-based management - Empower: Model leadership skills that sustain themselves and contributors. Benefits of Openness Drawn from Weller Altruism - It’s good to share knowledge. Some argue this makes work environments more inclusive and kinder. Efficiency - When working on hard problems, sharing knowledge and progress makes the larger project easier. This is a key argument for scientists to use open methods For instance Openscapes particularly in large scale research that requires a lot of researchers: e.g. genomic work, climate change, environmental science. Information Dissemination - You can share information and others can build upon it and use it. Participation and Collaboration - Bringing more participants into the work can make the work better and enable more ideas. Disrupts the isolation of the work we do and make sure the work we do is aligned with what we’re about. Models a new way of leading - Rookwood Institute You get feedback and can iterate towards better outcomes. Increases your profile - Your name is connected to this topic via search engine optimization. When people search for [topic], your name is attached. With open licensing, people know what they can/cannot do with your intellectual property. Drawbacks of Openness You may not trust everyone with this material and need aspects to be private. Monitoring Sometimes putting things online can equate to a demand to respond to topics or to be available. Being able to respond to what matters to you vs. what you are asked to respond to. It takes time/energy to establish and maintain an online identity. Downsides around openness online - Trolls/aggressive behavior. Particularly salient for POC/women and gender minorities and if you do work about sexism, harassment, etc. Also includes challenges with privacy that can come with being publicly online. For academics we can sometimes struggle with doing things perfectly. While you always choose what to put out, it may also be a challenge to receive feedback publicly. Open Licensing Most common of the open licenses which can be used for any kind of media is called Creative Commons. You always retain the copyright of your work. Licensing is a way of telling people what they can and cannot do with what you create. For people who are interested in sharing and disseminating knowledge and information, licences like Creative Commons make it easier to inform someone of what they can and cannot do with what you have created. Essentially, you’re telling people that within certain bounds, they can do things with your (or your organization’s) creations. Creative Commons has several licenses you can use: Please take a look at the website for more information on each of these licenses. The descriptions below are quoted directly from the CC website Attribution - CC BY - This license lets others distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials. Attribution - Share Alike - CC BY SA - This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects. Attribution No Derivs - CC BY-ND - This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form, and credit must be provided to you. Attribution - Non Commerical - CC BY NC - This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms. Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike - CC BY-NC-SA - This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. Attribution - Non Commercial No Derivs - CC BY-NC-ND - This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially. Open licenses still allow you to retain the copyright, but it gives direction to the public as to how they can and cannot use the materials you provide. Notes about Openness Trust is an important part of openness, it’s ok to choose who you are open with. Open Licenses do not mean giving up your intellectual property or your rights of ownership to the material. It means you are giving a license that is clear that folks can use it within the parameters you set.

["translating-academic-skills.html", "Translating Academic Skills Skills most academics have: Advice on Translating Skills Setting Conditions Translating your CV into a Resume Resources", " Translating Academic Skills What skills do we already posess? How can we translate these skills into new fields? What is the language we can use to talk about our skills? Skills most academics have: This section is entirely from History in High Heels We can read and write about complicated topics. We have research skills and we can draw from a wide variety of sources and we can analyze the validity of those sources. We work independently on complicated and difficult problems. We know how to take feedback/criticism. We can manage intense workloads. We are analytical “but we have to be creative in order to craft a persuasive argument.” We know how to work with a diverse range of people in a classroom. We solve problems. More things we can do: Epic attention to detail Able to pick out what’s important to do and what’s less important that I don’t have time to do Extraordinarily accountable (responsible) for our words/arguments/ideas Balancing the interests/needs of multiple stakeholders Selling myself and my work as useful and insightful and knowing how to put value to our work/skills outside of academia We can deal with legal confidentiality requirements, navigate bureaucracy, and legal/quasi-judicial proceedings We can give constructive feedback We can lead/motivate teams (students) We know how to learn effectively and how to think deeply on topics Multi-purposing: doing research, that we repurpose for teaching, both of which inform our service and community work Advice on Translating Skills I’m going to summarize a few of the different pockets of advice that I’ve seen on translating skills (with citations if you want to dive in more) for people with a PhD. Understand Your Skills One starting place is to make a list of what you like to do and then figure out what skills you use to do that. Knowing what you’re good at and what you like doing is a key part of this. Skills Inventory Understanding Conditions for Your Post Ac Career can help here too - you might be good at something but not be interested in doing it for a job or doing it in some industries might not meet your conditions. Who Needs Skills You Have? This is not something you’re likely to know without research, you have to dig. Ask questions of people in informational interviews “What field needs people who ____” Consider talking to people in the same job but in different industries too - this can be quite different (e.g. a UX researcher in health care vs. one in technology, or finance). - If no one knows what you’re talking about, try shifting the words that you’re using a bit. Talk about the skill using different language. What industries are out there? Look at the BLS - Bureau of Labor Statistics See also Learn the Jargon What’s the jargon? Make a list. Then define those terms for yourself and see if you can reframe your work in light of that jargon. For instance, UX jargon include: Insights, pain point, persona, breadcrumbs, wire frame, prototype, card sorting, iteration, journey, A/B testing etc. I didn’t know these terms when I started. But as someone who knows how to do research, I can ask questions, study and figure out what they’re talking about. Hot tip: you can ask this on social media “Hey UX researchers, anyone want to give me a good definition of wire framing? I’d be curious to see some really great case studies too.” You can also google “Jargon [JOB]” it’s surprisingly effective. Once you know the jargon, you can do the work of translating your skills to their terms. My examples: I discovered insights in my white paper which helped a nonprofit determine the journey of a key stakeholder. I’m skilled at using data to create insights. I’m capable of using a wide variety of tools such as interviewing, focus groups, persona development, cardsorts and A/B testing to get data driven insights that are useful. Here’s the crux. If you know how to use the jargon terms in your new field, you can determine if things you’ve done in the past are similar and can show your capacity to do that thing. EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE IT YET. What have you done that demonstrates that you are capable of ____? It drives me BATTY to hear academics tell me they have no leadership skillsIf you have taught a class, chaired a committee/department or first authored a group paper you are someone who has leadership skills. YOU have to do the translation work and explain how that means you’re capable of leading a team/department etc. Show evidence that you can do what an employer is asking for. Show Don’t Tell Share your skills and abilities by demonstrating what you can do instead of telling them you have the skills. “I have excellent managerial skills” vs. “Coordinated a brand new study abroad program for 16 students in a second language. Included travel to historical sites, volunteer placement and teaching advanced coursework.” If you don’t have evidence, what can you do that will show that you can do this? Include your volunteer work! Independent projects that demonstrate your knowledge (this works well for tech and very specific subject matter expertise) Job or project shadowing - sometimes you can work with someone for less money or no money so that you can gain experience. Don’t underestimate the power of curiosity and inquiry. You may not know how to do something, but being the person who asks the beginner question in an intelligent and enthusiastic way is actually a great way to make friends and get to know folks in the industry. Setting Conditions It can be helpful to set conditions for yourself in the kind of work you want to do next. Considering what your needs and desires are, is a part of finding work that makes sense for you. I wrote a piece on this if you’d like to read more. Make four lists: What are my Must Have’s? — What do you absolutely want? What are you are going for? What will I Not Tolerate? — What are your deal breakers? If you see this, you’re out. What would be Nice to Have? — You’ll be fine without these things, but in a dream world, you’d love to have it. What will I Accept? — This isn’t exactly what you want but you’ll make it work if it’s there. Side note that if you’re transitioning from a toxic environment, I strongly recommend spending some time on #2. Deciding that you will not tolerate certain kinds of behaviors and that you’ll look for certain indicators of the orientation of a new work environment can go a long way towards reestablishing for yourself a sense of safety. Translating your CV into a Resume My .02 is that you should set aside your CV when writing a resume and do the resume in response to a job ad. Write a resume that will help you land a job you want. So What are You Going to Do with That? This is my favorite book on the topic, they go into quite a bit of depth on the topic. Career Education - Columbia University A nice discussion of the differences and how to make the transition. Converting a CV to Resume - UC Davis - What I like about this is that it encourages you to consider using a functional combination vs. a chronological format resume. Worth considering if you’re wanting to share your skills that may come from a variety of settings. Inside Higher Ed Tailor the resume to the job you want. Describe the experiences you’re using to support your skills. Minimize academic conventions.

["networking.html", "Networking Informational Interviews Questions to ask in an informational interview? Resources", " Networking How can we make more connections to people outside of academia? But I’m an introvert/hate being skeezy/don’t want to bug people. What is an informational interview for? Informational Interviews Informational interviews are an incredibly important tool. Once you get the hang of them, they can be very helpful. I think there are a few myths about informational interviewing Myth #1 - They’re just for getting a job. You won’t likely get a job from an informational interview. Take the idea of getting a job off the table. This is not a job interview. Focus instead on people whose work seems interesting and who you’d like to know more about. You can absolutely do informational interviewing when you already have a job and just want to make connections and meet new people who do interesting things. Myth #2 - Info interviews are only helpful for the person who is asking to talk to the person with the cool job. Busy, interesting people with cool jobs know the importance of networking, but it can be hard to fit it into their life. If you make it easy for them to meet you, you are helping them make connections and talk to new people. You’re inviting them into YOUR growing network and you might also know information they don’t know. You also might tell them something they’ve never heard before. That’s worthwhile. Myth # 3 - You have to do a lot of homework before doing an informational interview You certainly can do homework and read up on the person and their work beforehand, it’s nice to do. But it’s also ok to walk into the conversation being genuinely curious about what they do and how they got there. Myth #4 - I have to do all the work to find people who are good to do an informational interview with. An easy question to ask your friends/relatives/acquaintances/people you meet is, who do you think might be interesting for me to talk to about ____? And you can fill in the blank with industries, job types, topics you find interesting. Your former students can sometimes be fascinating informaitonal interviews. What are you up to these days? How did you get into that? What do you love about your work? I know someone who did a cold email to someone whose magazine article she found interesting. That person became a close friend and colleague. If you would be interested in talking to them for fifteen minutes at a party, you can ask them to do an informational interview. Myth #5 - Informational interviews have to be in person. We live in the information age. USE TECHNOLOGY. If someone is down the street and their time is tight, a video conversation for 20 minutes may be all they’re available for. Take it. Do interviews with people who are not in our geographic region even if you don’t want to move. They may know about remote work opportunities or other kinds of work that you might appreciate. Or they might just have information that lets you write the perfect cover letter. Myth #6 - Informational interviews are only for extroverts Setting aside my thoughts about introversion or extroversion and what it really means, I think this myth is pervasive in that a lot of people who are shy or who don’t like crowds or strangers can struggle with. You can always ask questions. People like other people who ask questions and listen. If you are good at listening and letting other people talk, you will do FINE at informational interviewing. Just let people talk. Tips for Informational Interviewing DO not ask for a job. Do not ask for a job. DO NOT ask for a job. It makes it awkward, and they probably don’t have a job for you. Even if they do have a job for you, it’s probably not their decision. Let THEM encourage you to apply for a job. Schedule for no more than 30 minutes. Give them a conversational out if they need to get back to work after 25 minutes. Let THEM tell you if they want to spend more time with you. Have an elevator speech about who you are, but be thoughtful about how you say things. Temper your negative language and be conscious of how you tell your story. Consider talking about yourself in positive ways instead of negative ways. For instance: “I taught at the university for a few years but now I’m looking to pivot to nonprofit work/industry.” instead of “Being an adjunct is horrible so I said to hell with them, I want to work somewhere else”* Work to put things in language they might understand instead of the technical jargon of your field. &gt;“I’m a social scientist with an interest in technology, science and sustainability” instead of “I’m an organizational sociologist whose research focused on sector differences among ecological standard setting organizations.” It’s ok to not know what you’re going to do next. Most people who are outside of academia don’t know what they’re going to do next. Just be careful that you’re not too negative about it. Replace “I don’t know what I’m doing” with &quot;I’m curious about____&quot; or “I’d like to know more about ______.” Look for places you can be of use to them: “I read this article you might find interesting.” or “I know someone in ___ field who is doing that kind of work.” “Someone in my mentorship program was talking about the research she did on that topic.” Follow up follow up follow up!!! Follow them on social media. Send them an email with a thank you and any links/contacts you might have asked them for. &gt; Script: “Thanks so much for meeting with me, I really appreciated your thoughts about the future of your industry. I mentioned that article on beekeepers in New Zealand, here’s the link to it.” Remind them in the follow up email if there were any connections they offered to you: &gt;“I would really appreciate it if you were to connect me to Jane Doe at Incredible Corporation, she sounds like a fascinating person and I’d love to talk with her about her work making the world a better place” “If any other ideas for people who I might chat with come to mind, please let me know.” Rinse repeat. Questions to ask in an informational interview? Tell me how you got into doing this work. What is your job like? What do you love about it? What is challenging? What are the big challenges/pain points right now in [industry]? What do you think the upcoming trends are in your field/industry? What conferences are really worth going to in your field? Why did you like them? Who should I be reading? Who can help me learn more about this field or industry? I really love doing [skill], but I’m trying to figure out where I might be able to do that kind of work. What thoughts do you have? What does your typical day (or week) look like? What qualities or specific skills/proficiencies do you look for in a job candidate? What are the growth areas in your industry? What are the biggest challenges in your field/sector/job/company? What led you to this work? (a variation on how did you find this work/job?) Who else do you think I should talk to? How might I start in this field? What do you see yourself doing in 5 years?

["finding-purpose-and-meaning.html", "Finding Purpose and Meaning What matters? Problem Solving and Meaning Design Thinking Resources", " Finding Purpose and Meaning What problems need solving? What matters to me? What are the pain points we can see in the world around us? How can we help? What matters? One of the things I’ve noticed and heard from others leaving academia is a sense of missing purpose and meaning. For me, it’s helpful to remind myself of what really matters to me, to return to the things that I value. I’d like you to take a few minutes to write on your own about this. The point is to give ourselves time to just let the fingers fly/pen go about what REALLY matters to us now. Go wherever this makes sense for you right now. If it’s deep and profound, that’s great. If it’s about the cat on your lap or the cup of coffee next to you, that’s great too. There’s no judgement here. What really matters to you? Problem Solving and Meaning The ability to solve problems, to work on tricky questions and to deal with complexity is something most academics are really capable of. Yet when it comes to our own personal transitions, it’s much harder to solve our own problems. We might consider: What problems are we interested in working on? What problems seem to us worth solving? How might we use the skills we have in service to problems that exist in the world? This does not have to be entirely altruistic or on the other end of the spectrum entirely profit driven. Different sectors frame this in different ways: Nonprofits are interested in the problem of changing a social condition, or better providing services to those who need them. Government is looking to use taxpayer dollars wisely, do the work for the common good and to serve the public. They are solving problems from trash collection to income taxes to international relationships. Industry wants to solve “pain points” for users or fill market niches or to give their shareholder earnings. They are interested in solving diverse problems like curing cancer, getting food to eat, how to communicate with others, travel and even solving boredom. Social benefit organizations are looking to make a profit and to make a difference. They want to mix and match so that they can both socially benefit society and make money for shareholders. Education is solving the problem of a lack of knowledge and a need to be skilled. These industries are essentially all doing the same thing which is to look for solutions to problems. What happens if we reverse engineer this and say: What problems do I want to be working on? Another approach is to look at the stakeholders - or people who care what happens regarding a particular problem and for whom the approach and outcome of the problem solving matters. Which stakeholders do I want to support? Who do I want to help? For instance, I like hanging out with people who have PhD’s, one of the reasons I created the Athenas and the Open Post Acs Mentorship Program The university did this work for us when we were inside the institution. We were told that we were teaching for our students and that we were supporting their growth and development as humans. We worked within a field where there were certain kinds of problems we were encouraged to approach. What would it look like to ask ourselves what we WANT to work on? Design Thinking I’m going to share a design thinking mindset around meaning and purpose. Design thinking is an approach to problem solving that focuses on Empathy (thinking about what the people with the problem are facing) Ideation (generating a lot of ideas) and Experimentation (trying stuff out). Generally design thinkers have Curiosity towards problems Flexibility about process and outcome A bias towards action This might be useful for us as we try to figure out next steps. A book called Designing your Life is a good starting place, where the authors take design thinking and ask you to apply it to your life and where you’re headed next. A few of the provocations in there are interesting to consider as we look towards what we might do next and what matters to us. In discussing “feeling stuck” they advocate generating a lot of ideas and never settling on the first ideas you think of. What this does is to force you into a more flexible mindset around how to solve problems. You aren’t “stuck” with one solution, you start to envision multiple solutions. The book also asks you to consider what things you do in your life that recharge your energy and those things you do that detract from your energy. They have exercises to help determine what recharges you and what detracts for you. What would it be like to do more of the things that recharge your energy and less of those which take from it? In one chapter, they suggest coming up with three separate future paths for yourself that you would very much like to have. Essentially allowing yourself to ideate on what your future might look like. Then taking those three possible paths, consider what it might look like for the next five years in each one. Their approach to job seeking, making decisions and “failure” are also very much worth investigating. Design thinking asks you to calibrate based on the things you value and to work to get past your blocks by thinking up a lot of ideas and trying things out. Resources There’s the idea of Multi potentiates - or people who have multiple interests. How To Be Everything Business Model Canvas: Useful for thinking through a business model and the kinds of problems and how you’d solve them from a business or an entrepreneurship standpoint. You may have heard already of the idea of a flow state, driven by research from a psychologist named Csikszentmihalyi. One way to understand flow state is it happens when you lose track of time. More thoughts on how to get to a flow state. It can be helpful to think through what puts you into flow state as a way of thinking about what you might do next. Also for small businesses: Small Business Development Centers are all over the country, and offer free consulting services on everything from financials to marketing, plus classes, networking events, etc. "],
["changing-identities.html", "Changing Identities Identity and Post Academics Four Metaphors Exercise", " Changing Identities Who are you outside of the academy? How do we respond to the question “What do you do?” when we don’t know? What if I’m overqualified? Identity and Post Academics When I researched and wrote the white paper What I Wish I had Known one of the key findings was around identity and emotions. I want to share part of that section of the paper with you here in hopes it can be the starting point for our discussion today. All of the quotes are from people who have left academia and who are answering what they wish they had known when they were leaving the academy. Many respondents described leaving academia as emotionally fraught. Some felt as if they were not only leaving their career and trying to find a new livelihood but also abandoning their identity along with it. “I wish I had known how long the transition would take, and how high the emotional toll would be. I lost a major part of my identity, though now I am learning that many of the things that made me love academia—it satisfied my unrelenting curiosity, allowed me to work through ideas in long-term projects, helped me constantly raise new questions—are still part of my life and work. I am now trying to find new ways to define myself, and it is frightening but also exciting.” “Your self-concept has to change, and that is a huge undertaking. It will take time. Be gentle with yourself, be hopeful and optimistic, and find a support network to keep you going when it’s hard. Don’t settle for a life that’s less than you want. There’s a whole world out there.” “DO IT!!! It’s so much better out here. But be prepared to totally overhaul your beliefs and values and dreams too.” *“Your whole identity will change.” Respondents wished they had known they would face emotions like anger, sadness, shame, loss, and grief. They said that those emotions lingered throughout the process of leaving and even beyond the transition. “You’re not worthless, and neither is your degree. Academia is great at convincing us we have no value. If you can get yourself to a place where you see the value in yourself and your abilities/education beyond academia, you’ll start seeing possibilities again. And that’s a really hopeful, abundant feeling.” “The tremendous sense of loss and grief and anger that I’d feel. How lost I would feel, for years. And that it’s relatively common for post-acs to experience this.” “How angry and betrayed I would feel.” The transition took longer than respondents expected. They described the shift being more than just “adjusting to a new job” and said that they needed to look at the change in terms of years rather than months. “Also, don’t think this will be a quick transition. So many people told me it takes 3 to 6 months to adjust to a new job, but none of those people understood that a transfer out of academia is far different from switching jobs. Anticipate the adjustment taking no less than a year, but likely several more.” “Prepare for the transition, read others’ stories, know that it may take 3 years before you feel ‘normal’ again.” Some also described finding a “new narrative” to understand or explain their story and indicate that this changed the way they thought about their career and their work. “Bridging occasional academic work and journalism can be quite challenging because they’re such major mindset shifts. More than I anticipated. While I enjoy consulting from time to time and teaching a class here and there, I find I no longer have patience for the way that academia sucks you in, demanding such intensely deep but narrow attention. Part of what I love about freelancing is I get to learn about a lot of things while constantly working on my skills as a writer and interviewer. I’m sometimes not sure if doing both is sustainable for me long-term.” “The biggest ‘aha!’ I’ve had since leaving the academy and starting a business is that, whether the business succeeds or fails, I have changed my narrative. Any interview I walk into after this, I walk into as an entrepreneur—it’s my choice to talk about my academic background or not.” Respondents discussed needing to find ways to express their own worthiness and the value of their degree. Some found ways to see their choice as valuable even as the academy may have deemed them not worthy. “I think that what is important is not to pin your self-worth on academic accomplishments. I tell my students, don’t wait to ‘start your life’ when you graduate, because it will always be different versions of the same. Live now the way you want to live.” “You will likely have a greater sense of self worth and that your intellect matters on the outside and just bc u leave academia doesn’t mean you don’t use those skills or write etc.” “Self care is not a luxury. And from what I witnessed, politics (and male-bonding over golf) usually have more to do with professional success than actual performance and accomplishment, so don’t judge your own merit solely on rewards you may or may not have received.” “You are so much more valuable than the academy deems you. Get out and do things in the world!” Four Metaphors Exercise I’ve heard four main metaphors folks who have left academia have used to describe their relationship with the academy. These are very strong metaphors, so please know that I am not saying that academia is or was these things. Particularly if you have experienced one or more of these in reality, you may find the comparison jarring or inappropriate. I am simply pointing out that others who have been through this process have used these metaphors to describe their time leaving academia. I offer them as a way to grapple with and investigate your own experience. If the metaphor does not serve you, please set it aside. The questions below are designed to help you think through how these metaphors might relate. Want more questions? I wrote up more on these metaphors here. Academia as: A Romantic Relationship - Was it an unrequited love, a deep attraction or an abusive or indifferent partner? - Was the ending a divorce, a tentative separation or a breakup? An Addiction - Where did you feel a high from your academic work or life? When did you feel low? - When did you feel powerless in the academic life you lived? A Cult - What false beliefs did you internalize as a part of being in academic settings? - What was secret or exclusive about academia? An Ivory Tower - Where were you isolated or kept apart from the rest of the world? - What was esoteric or hard to explain about your academic career? "],
["knowledge-sharing.html", "Knowledge Sharing Scholarship Outside of the Academy Media for Post Academics", " Knowledge Sharing What tools do we have to share our knowledge? What could we develop that would help us find more ways to share our knowledge? What does scholarship and being a scholar look like outside of the academy? Scholarship Outside of the Academy One key fear I hear from folks who are worried about leaving academia is that they really don’t want to lose their institutional affiliation and their library access. I get it. It feels like a lifeline for scholars to be connected to the information we’ve always had. That said, I think it underscores the larger problems we have in the academy around isolation and keeping people away from the deep knowledge. We are not exiles, we are still researchers and scholars. So how can we continue to be connected to the knowledge and to contribute to knowledge? Below are a series of assorted resources to help you find the way forward. Library access without institutional affiliation is hard to get. Research Access is a challenge. Direct Library Access Some Universities will allow Alumni to access their library system. It’s worth at least asking the alumni association for your alma mater, particularly if they’re doing a capital campaign, you can push them towards letting you have access. JSTOR allows access for some Alumni Alums from the University of California System can get library cards Check out your local public universities and local colleges and request access as a community member. These can sometimes be inexpensive, but usually they also will at least allow you to browse books and databases. Public libraries are getting more and more digital, make sure you check in to your local library as well, while they may not have all of the journals you might want, they may have access to inter library loan books or even ebooks of texts you might want. Some association memberships will also give you library access: - Organization of American Historians (OAH) - American Academy of Religion offers some access. - National Coalition of Independent Scholars (NCIS) provides access at a reduced cost to Jstor to members Workarounds Some communities will enable informal journal article swaps or peer exchanges. - Several groups I am involved with such as the AAAS Alumni groups regularly allow one another to circulate requests for pdfs of journal articles among those who still have access to university journal databases. - Consider requesting such pdfs from people you know who are still with institutions. - The hashtag #icanhazpdf on Twitter will help you get articles. - You can also email the author and see if they’d be willing to send it to you. They probably want you to read (and cite!) their article. University Affiliation Network with your nearby universities and see if they might be willing to let you affiliate with the university in exchange for speaking to a class, delivering a brown bag lecture or otherwise contributing to the intellectual community. &gt; Words you can use to describe this: visiting scholar, designated campus colleague, research affiliate, research assistant professor. It’s mostly about paperwork and connections to people who will sponsor you to do this work. If you know someone who trusts you at a university it makes it easier. If you belonged to a research group during your PhD, your supervisor might have the ability to continue your library access through affiliation. This can be an easy request to add on to existing adjunct work. “I will do this one class if you will give me research affiliation for the next academic calendar” Some people I know take the cheapest “informal class” offered by the large local public university, as this gives them student access to the library resources. Check alternative education opportunities such as community colleges or even underground universities such as Portland Underground Graduate Studies. Open Access Open Access and the Open movement as a whole has been key in helping to create more access for researchers outside of academic environments. Open projects highlight the benefit of openness as a mindset. If we believe that all people should be able to have access to information, as many folks in library and academic circles do, why would we limit access to knowledge? SPARC - Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition “Open Access is the free, immediate, online availability of research articles coupled with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment. Open Access ensures that anyone can access and use these results - to turn ideas into industries and breakthroughs into better lives.” What is Open Access? “Open access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available to anyone interested in reading it.” FANTASTIC explanation in cartoon format from PHD comics PLOS - Why Open Access? Subject Repositories These are a growing way for researchers to share their emerging projects and data. I’ve also found that it’s a great way to share my mostly baked but not accepted papers that I don’t want to leave languishing on my hard drive. SocARXIV - The sociology open archive, you can see my two papers if you’d like an idea of what it looks like. Humanities Commons - Includes scholarship and teaching materials Original arXiv.org - for physics, math, biology, stats etc. Directory of Open Access Repositories (DOAR) Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) CORE - Collection of Open Access Research Papers PhilPapers post and pre/un-print Books &amp; Online Libraries Open Library - “Our goal is to provide a page on the web for every book ever published.” Internet Archive - &quot;a nonprofit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites and more. Project Gutenberg- “A library of over 60,000 free eBooks” Hathi Trust - Books and digitized titles online Museums There are museums who are sharing their images with the world openly Smithsonian National Gallery of Art More Resources Chronicle Vitae article on Resources for the Academic Solo Artist Researcher Without a Library - Jake Orlowitz This is a nice layout of the Swedish open data center Google Scholar(https://scholar.google.com/) - Surprisingly good at linking to OA resources when they’re available. Use Research Gate or Academia.edu to contact researchers and ask them directly for their work. Wiki Commons Independent Scholars? Should we reconsider the phrase “Independent Scholar”? What if we were to refer to ourselves instead as “Scholars” or simply people who practice in our field? “Outside of academe, this terminology makes no sense. There are no”independent lawyers&quot; or “independent businesswomen,” because what would that even mean? They are simply lawyers and businesswomen, whether they work for themselves, for small firms, or large corporations.&quot; - (The Chronicle of Higher Education) I sometimes refer to myself as a social scientist and a researcher. There is no reason I need to identify by a lack of affiliation, I’ve still got a degree in sociology. Some like the idea of being a “public scholar” because it shows that you want to serve the public. Resources for Independent Scholars National Coalition of Independent Scholars - I’m not a member, but there may be resources here that are useful. - Being a member gives you access to Jstor at reduced cost, and $600 grant funding for selected researchers Canadian Academy of Independent Scholars offers library access and small grants.

["exercises.html", "Exercises Broadening The Story", " Exercises This is a spot where we’ve put all of the exercises that we’ve used in this workshop (and a couple we haven’t) in one place. Broadening The Story In this exercise, we’re working with what has happened to us and asking some questions to examine our experiences more broadly. We want to seek a wider understanding of what happened with regard to the institutions and fields that we are a part of and start to ask these institutions and structures to be more accountable for what occurred. 0.0.1 1) Describe what happened to you. Describe something that happened that still hurts. Write out for yourself what it looked like from your perspective. Really let yourself take some time to write out the grievance and all the players in your story. If your story is too raw for you and you’d still like some practice at broadening a story. It is sometimes easier to look at other people’s stories instead of your own. Below are three examples that you can use for discussion. 0.0.2 2) Who else might have experienced something similar? Do you know of anyone else who has experienced something similar to what you have? If the answer is yes, then describe who it is. How are they similar to you? In what ways did they experience what you experienced? If you don’t know anyone who has experienced something similar, start by considering if it’s theoretically possible for others to have had something similar happen to them. If so, try to imagine who might be able to relate (yes, you are using your imagination here). Consider generalizing to a group of people. Could you imagine other women experiencing something similar at a different university? Would other junior faculty members understand this? Are there other people who are invisibly disabled who would understand? Are there others in your field who could understand your challenge? This is also a good time to look for first person accounts of such issues and in particular to see if there is any Quit Lit that is similar. Start with the resources section in this lesson and go through to see which of them is most closely related to what you experienced. 0.0.3 3) Who has power and who does not? In looking at your story, now it’s time to consider the power structure. Is there a power imbalance here? Where did you have power? Where did someone have power over you? What were the things that were out of your control? Who has recourse? Who does not have recourse? Did the power structure have any influence on what happened? Would there have been a different outcome if you had had more power or a different kind of power? Consider that there are different types of power. Original article with 5 power types here What kinds of power did you have? What kinds of power were used over you? 0.0.4 4) What role did the institution(s) play in your story? For the next question it’s helpful to think through different types of institutions that might be involved and make sure we’re thinking past just the university where you went to school or were employed. Consider also: your disciplinary area of study and sub disciplinary groups, the state, the academic publishing industry, the journal system, the student loan and banking industry, the Greek System, your alma mater, the Ivies, athletics, alumni networks, the board of directors, the academic community as a whole, heteronormativity, privilege, patriarchal structures, the boys network, What did the institution actually do (or not do)? Did anyone suggest that the institution would do something? What did they say? What actually happened? Was the power difference upheld by an institution? How? Are there hypocrisies in the actual actions taken (or not taken) by the institution? 0.0.5 5) What cultural beliefs supports those with power in your story? What are the beliefs in these institutions that you named above, or broader beliefs that may have led to supporting what happened to you? Cultural beliefs can be thought of as “the way we do things here” Some examples of cultural beliefs include statements like: People who go to Ivy League schools/ have tenure/have Ph.D’s are smarter. Employees will stay in their position - no matter how precarious - if the school is prestigious/they have tenure/they get enough money. Graduate students who are parents/women/minorities/first generation don’t make it through the program. Women are better at note taking/committee or service work/advising/mentorship/teaching than men. Without a successful grant/published book/five articles, you won’t get tenure. If you don’t succeed on the job market after two years/a Visiting Position/not getting an offer, you won’t get a job. There’s no reason to hire an applicant if they: are a trailing spouse/haven’t gotten a tenure track job after two years/haven’t published a solo article. 0.0.6 6) How does your reflection on these questions lead you to retell the story you told at the beginning? What does a broader perspective add to your understanding of what happened to you? 0.0.7 Extra Credit: Fictional Stories It can sometimes help to do the Broadening the Story exercise on someone else’s story. Particularly if you’re having trouble figuring out how to do this with your own story, start by working on some fictional stories to get your mind around the task. (CW: assault) Jane is in her first year of teaching as a visiting assistant professor at a prestigious school she’d love to stay at. She was on the job market and gets an offer from a less prestigious college. She isn’t sure if she wants to take it. Ideally, she’d stay where she is and get a tenure track position, something the dean has hinted at. He said he a little while ago he could fund her for another year and is looking for the resources for a line for her. She hasn’t received a contract in the mail from him for the next year, though he claims that’s not a big deal. She tells him she needs a contract before the decision is requested by the university that wants to hire her. He doesn’t respond. When she takes the other job, all of her colleagues including the dean are astonished that she would leave for a “less desirable” school. Marcia is a post doc in a lab and she has been increasingly concerned about her advisor’s behavior with the international graduate students that depend on their status in the department for their visa. The advisor has made comments in lab meetings about “deportation” and joked that he can just take back their funding if they don’t do their work as quickly as he wants it done. When one grad student wanted to go home for a family funeral, the lab director made comments about her going on “vacation” and that people don’t just get time off any time they want it. Marcia has gone to the dean to talk about her advisor’s behavior. He listens and says that he’s friends with the professor and will talk to him. A week after talking to the dean, her advisor says to the lab that someone is “out to get him” and he thinks it’s one of the international students. Jake is a professor in his first year and he often travels to the city nearby to get some work done, see some friends and go on dates. He hasn’t come out to any of his colleagues and doesn’t wish to. On a night when he’s out with a date with a man, he sees a female colleague who seems shocked at seeing him kiss a man. She exclaims that she didn’t know he was gay. He considers himself bisexual but does not wish to have that conversation with his colleague, nor for his sexuality to be a part of his work environment. When he returns to campus, a colleague says something to him which makes him realize she has outed him without his consent. Use these fictional examples to go through the Broadening the Story questions. How can you recontextualize each of these stories? "],

Human homework is the act of finding some way to honestly reflect on and work with any kind of dissonance or disruption within yourself. It often involves truth telling about challenging experiences you’ve had and walking through the stories you’ve told and the emotions that resulted. It is not avoiding what happened, or pretending it didn’t happen or trying to numb out. It is facing ourselves. We never really finish doing our human homework, so this isn’t something you accomplish (although maybe enlightened people are done? I don’t know - I’m not enlightened). For most, human homework is a set of questions, or a way to respond to emotions when you’re facing tough times. It’s about being deeply honest with ourselves about experiences that called into conflict our core ideas about the way the world works and what we are doing here. There are about as many ways to do human homework as there are people in the world. When you’re going through transitions this kind of work is vital because we are usually experiencing some sort of disruption in who we are, what we do, what we have to offer. There can be very real, very important reasons why you might not want to face all of this emotional work. Not the least of which is that you have deep trauma or childhood pains. Please be gentle with yourself and get support if you need it Trust yourself when something feels too delicate to approach. Blocks for Academics One of the biggest imepdements to doing this work for people leaving academic positions is that many of us who are making these big transitions are also going through financial challenges at the same time. It’s can be very hard to do deep emotional work on yourself when you don’t have any money. Heck the scarcity of not having money ITSELF can more deeply aggravate the emotional challenges you’re facing. This is entirely real, you’re not making this up and I’m sorry if that’s where you are right now. You CAN do human homework without it costing money. There are a ton of resources below, go to the library and look through the books you see until one of them speaks to you and do the exercises in the book. Consider also that there are places that have resources for you even if you don’t have money. Consider asking for a price break because of economic hardship. Consider modalities where you can work with students or interns who are learning and can still give you quality care. Ask for help when you need it. Another block for many academics, is the capacity to turn our very well-honed critical lenses onto the whole idea of doing any work on ourselves at all. In fields where we pride ourselves on being unbiased, looking at our inner landscape can be frightening and deeply challenging to our core beliefs. We may out of hand reject anything that is not scientifically based. We may see reject something out of hand because it contains something we judge to be “nonsense”. If you are an atheist or agnostic, you may find any mention of a higher power, God or even meditation or religion to be offputting. In fields where there is a belief that a “good” practitioner in the field has already dealt with these things, there can be a block to being someone who has to do more work or to trying something that is not sanctioned by your field. You might have opinions around subfields or authors, you might be resistant to something a colleague has dismissed. You may also have beliefs around what people would think of you if they knew you were doing your human homework. This is all resistance. I believe that ALL people need to do their human homework. All of us need to take time to investigate challenging experiences, to reaffirm our core beliefs and to heal from disruptive events. I don’t think it matters what you do, but I do think it helps to move towards being a whole human. Human Homework Resources To that end, I’ve compiled a list of resources as a starting place. Some of these may intrigue you, while others may turn you off. Just find the resources or methods that make sense to you and work with those. If you have other suggestions of resources for doing your human homework please contribute them. Academics Doing Human Homework Brene Brown Brene Brown is a professor of social work at UT Austin who did a TEDx talk that went viral about the power of vulnerability. She has a follow up talk about listening to shame and has written several books based on her research. Among them are Rising Strong, Daring Greatly and the Gifts of Imperfection. Kristen Neff Her book on Self-Compassion works with existing research and explores how to cultivate and create practices of self-compassion in your life. Her website includes meditations and training programs. Parker Palmer and the Center for Courage and Renewal A former academic, Parker writes about his experiences and share insights from the Quaker tradition and his time with the retreat center Pendle Hill. His books include Let Your Life Speak and A Hidden Wholeness. He works with the Center for Courage and Renewal to create retreats and other seminars and his books focus on connecting to your purpose in life. Martha Beck Martha is a former academic who has written memoirs, self help books and has created a tribe of people who are focused on finding direction. Among her books: Finding Your Own North Star, Steering By Starlight, Finding Your Way in a Wild New World. Viktor Frankl’s book “A Man’s Search for Meaning” is written by a psychologist, chronicling his experiences in Auchwitz and how he came out of that experience to find meaning in his life. Books and Programs The Sedona Method The Sedona Method is a technique of asking a sequence of questions that encourages the practitioner to “let go” of whatever emotions they are feeling in the moment. The technique is simple, but the book traces a number of ways to integrate this into one’s life. Byron Katie engages in what she calls “The Work” which asks the participant to engage with their experiences in the world and ask questions about what they believe to tell the truth. The basics of working with her method are freely available on her website as are videos of her working with people.
